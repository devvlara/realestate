Overview
The main goal of this project is to:
1.	Collect data from public sources.
2.	Clean and structure the data consistently.
3.	Develop analytical tools to explore the data from new angles.
4.	Make informed, data-driven decisions from a fresh perspective.
5.	Gain experience in data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and analysis.

Motivation
There are numerous data science projects to choose from, many of which rely heavily on a "copy-and-paste" approach. However, I selected this specific real estate project because of my personal interest in homeownership and the abundance of public data available. This project not only aligns with my future goal of owning a home but also offers the chance to delve into data that influences the housing market, all while applying and advancing my data science skills.

Data sources used:
•	Zillow Public Data
•	Zillow Search Scraper API
•	Federal Reserve Economic Data
•	US Census
•	SimpleMaps

Data Availability
•	Home Values, Home Value Forecasts, Rental data, For Sale Listings, Sold Listings,  Market Metrics, New Construction
•	Specific Home Listings
•	Federal Interest Rates
•	Population, Median Income
•	Area Granularity (Country, State, Metro, County, City, Neighborhood, Zip code)
